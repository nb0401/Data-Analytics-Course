# Data-Analytics-Course

These are the projects I worked on in my Data Analytics Course:


1. A presentation about marketing recommendations in the video game sector for a fictive company using past sales data (up to 2016) for the next year (2017). Using a public domain data set with excel I created a presentation for the executive board of the fictive company "GameCo".

2. An interim report about the midterm findings of a project for a fictive medical staffing company regarding recommendations about where to send medical staff to support clinics and hospitals for the next influenza season in the US using past data. The key aspects were to find out which sort of population is the most vulnerable and in which states the most of these residents live. Using this knowledge to give a recommendation and a ranking for the US-States that can be used to send the medical staff.
