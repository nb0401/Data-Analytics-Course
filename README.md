# Data-Analytics-Course

These are the projects I worked on in my Data Analytics Course:


1. A presentation about marketing recommendations in the video game sector for a fictive company using past sales data (up to 2016) for the next year (2017). Using a public domain data set with excel I created a presentation for the executive board of the fictive company "GameCo".

2. An interim report about the midterm findings of a project for a fictive medical staffing company regarding recommendations about where to send medical staff to support clinics and hospitals for the next influenza season in the US using past data. The key aspects were to find out which sort of population is the most vulnerable and in which states the most of these residents live. Using this knowledge to give a recommendation and a ranking for the US-States that can be used to send the medical staff.

3. In the role of a data analyst hired by the fictional company "Rockbuster Stealth LLC" (a movie rental company), I have to work with SQL (PostgreSQL) to gain information to answer key questions from the stakeholders. Additional gaining insights is another part of the task, these insights should help improve the overall performance of the company. Furthermore, regarding the rise of other online video rental services, the Rockbuster Stealth business intelligence department needs help with the launch strategy for a new online video service. Finding information helping this launch is also a key component of the project task.

4. The company Instacart published a dataset (“The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, Accessed from https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 on 08.06.2022 [DD-MM-YYYY].) on which I perform an analysis using python / jupyter. The goal is to gain information about the behavior and ordering patterns of the customers inside the database, answering key questions from the stakeholders, and finding insights increasing the sales performance. Therefore multiple dataframes have to be cleaned, wrangled, merged together, and analyzed using pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib.

5. Using data from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and the SCORE network, I created an Open Data Project which analyses the metabolites of wastewater in European cities to gain insights on the drug consumption behaviour. The situation of drug consumption is a general area of focus in the political world. To gain further insights, I looked at the drug consumption levels of specific drugs and their correlation with each other. In conclusion, with the knowledge about the correlation, I can say, that the consumption level of each drug has to be taken individually. Therefore, the drug situation has to be fought individually and not as a whole.
