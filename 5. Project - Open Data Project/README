# Using Metabolites in the Wastewater to measure Drug Consumption

## Objective

The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is the leading institution studying the drug usage and spreading information about 
drug addiction in Europe. The EMCDDA works to support the EU and its nations in policymaking to protect its citizens from drug-related harms. In cooperation 
with the SCORE network, which is a network of wastewater-based epidemiology experts, the organizations collected data of the wastewaters of major EU cities 
to research the drug usage of the citizens.

My task was to research the drug situation in Europe, using multiple tools and methods. Additionally I suggest to take a look at the public Tableau presentation:
