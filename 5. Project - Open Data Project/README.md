# Using Metabolites in the Wastewater to measure Drug Consumption

## Objective

The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is the leading institution studying the drug usage and spreading information about 
drug addiction in Europe. The EMCDDA works to support the EU and its nations in policymaking to protect its citizens from drug-related harms. In cooperation 
with the SCORE network, which is a network of wastewater-based epidemiology experts, the organizations collected data of the wastewaters of major EU cities 
to research the drug usage of the citizens.

My task was to research the drug situation in Europe, using multiple tools and methods. Additionally I suggest to take a look at the public Tableau presentation:

## Content:

In this project folder you will find, a business-like folder structure containing the important files of the project:

1. "01 Project Management" - this is an example folder, since there is no project client.

2. "02 Data" - here you would find the datasets/-frames used and changed. However, since this project is published under my GitHub profile, this folder is empty.
   The original data sources can be found in the notebooks.

3. "03 Scripts" - here you can find the scripts created for the project. There are 6 notebooks/scripts:

        1. 6.1 which is about the sourcing and cleaning of the datasets.
        2. 6.2 which is about exploring relationships and correlations.
        3. 6.3 which is about a geospatial analysis using folium and json libraries for python.
        4. 6.4 which is about autoregression (linear regression) using the sklearn library for python.
        5. 6.5 which is about clustering (kmean) using the sklearn library for python.
        6. 6.6 which is about time series forecasting (ARMA and ARIMA) using the statsmodel library for python.

4. "04 Analysis" - here all visualizations created with matplotlib, seabron and pyplot can be found. (Sorted by the a folder pattern similar to the one in
   "03 Scripts".

5. "05 Sent to Client" - this is an example folder, since there is no project client.
